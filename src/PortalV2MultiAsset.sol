 * The deposits are redirected to an external protocol to generate yield
 * Users accrue portalEnergy points over time while staking their tokens
 * portalEnergy can be exchanged against the PSM token using the internal Liquidity Pool or minted as ERC20
 * PortalEnergy Tokens can be burned to increase a recipient internal portalEnergy balance
 * Users can buy more portalEnergy via the internal LP by spending PSM
 * bTokens received during the funding phase are used to initialize the internal LP
 * bTokens can be redeemed against the fundingRewardPool which consists of PSM tokens
 * Users can mint NFTs that represent their current account balances
 * These NFTs can be transferred and redeemed to add their balances back to an internal account
