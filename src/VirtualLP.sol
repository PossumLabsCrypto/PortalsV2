/// @title Portal V2 Virtual LP
/// @author Possum Labs
/**
 * @notice This contract serves as the shared, virtual LP for multiple Portals
 * Each Portal must be registered by the owner
 * The contract is owned for a predetermined duration to enable registering Portals
 * Registering Portals must be permissioned because it can be malicious
 * Portals cannot be removed from the registry to guarantee Portal integrity
 * The full amount of PSM inside the LP is available to provide upfront yield for each Portal
 * Capital staked through the connected Portals is redirected and staked in an external yield source
 * Yield is claimed and collected with this contract
 * The contract can receive PSM tokens during the funding phase and issues bTokens as receipt
 * bTokens received during the funding phase are used to initialize the internal LP
 * bTokens can be redeemed against the fundingRewardPool which consists of PSM tokens
 * The fundingRewardPool is filled over time by taking a 10% cut from the Converter
 * The Converter is an arbitrage mechanism that allows anyone to sweep the contract balance of a token
 * When triggering the Converter, the caller (arbitrager) must send a fixed amount of PSM tokens to the contract
 * Setup Process: 1. deploy VirtualLP, 2. deploy Portals, 3. register Portals in VirtualLP
 * 4. mint tokens, 5. increase allowances, 6. activate LP after funding concluded
